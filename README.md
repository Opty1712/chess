# This is a decision of the technical task

## Using React:
1. Display a chessboard with a default FEN of: 8/2p5/8/8/8/8/8/8 w KQkq - 0 1
2. Include a button that adds a white pawn to a random legal position on the board.
3. Allow that pawn to make legal moves across the board.
4. Do not use any 3rd-party chess libraries.
5. Return your code in an online executable sandbox, such as https://codesandbox.io/


#### Open questions
1. As I wasnâ€™t familiar with FEN I want to clarify that I understood the initial position correctly. Is it the empty board with the only black pawn on G3 field?
2. Do I need to develop futher scenario when pawn gets 8th line (changing pawn to queen)?
3. Is 8th line a legal position for random white pawn? And the 1st line? If it is not a real game, but just task.
4. Do you rate only the final app without analazing project itself (code style / architecture / unit tests)? Codesandbox or others do not provide such functionality 100%. When I hire developers I always watch their GitHub.
